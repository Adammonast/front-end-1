# Weight Lifting Journal

> This repository contains the front-end for the collaborative project Weight Lifting Journal. Within this app, expect to find an application with CRUD functionality allowing users to log their workouts!

Weight Lifting Journal is a web application for keeping track of a workout routine. This project was a collaborative effort between of a team of 5 cross-functional developers, completed in 1 week. The application was created using React, React Router, and vanilla CSS. I (Adam Monast) was personally responsible for implementing sign-in/sign up forms and functionality, and styling the entire project. 

Future plans for this project include: Fixing the bugs with adding body weight entries, implementing my own backend API to power the app (I do not have access to the current one), implementing a better state management system using Redux, and fixing styling issues the deployed site is experiecing. Thank you for viewing this project and all feedback is appreciated!
